            <pre>
            Pin's escape is a game my team and I produced for as an exam performance.
            It had to include a 3D-space with code based mesh generation,
            a playable player, sounds, using textured materials and shaders. 

            So the four of us generated the idea and split the tasks.
            Idea being, a penguin who has to find its way through a maze.
            Difficulty being, that it's very dark and seals are hunting you.
            Though one can shoot light bullets to light the way.  

            My role: 
            My job was to take care of the player as well as the 
            bullet and shooting mechanism.
            I sketched out multiple deigns and ended up with 
            a code generated cone mesh that sticks in the ground and 
            has a light attached to it, to light the way through the maze.
            Further responsibilities contain the designing and framing of 
            70% of the visual footage captured with the cinemachine package
            from Unity to produce the trailer.
            
            Equipment:
            PCs and a dynamic and calm teamwork atmosphere that allows 
            everyone to play out their strength

            Software: 
            Unity, GitHub, Visual Studio Community Edition 
            
            Lessons learned: 
            Better keep the git repo organised.
