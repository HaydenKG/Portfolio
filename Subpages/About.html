            Hello  
            My name is Hayden and I enjoy creating software that
            helps people to learn things, explore the world 
            or maintain their health.
            
            My interest for software development was sparked in school and 
            even more during a side project in which I designed and 
            programmed a little android game to enhance my programming skills.
            But the decision to study digital media came during my 
            work and travel in New Zealand, where I got to help others with 
            little technological problems. 
            
            Fast-forward to today I finished my Bc. S. in Digital Media and 
            learned many things in the process like media production, 
            programming, visual design, UX-testing, Web-related technologies 
            or E-Learning. 
            That, in combination with things I taught myself with the help 
            of the internet, allows me to build software that can 
            support people in, par example, training their balance <a
                href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RHApplicationStudio.BalanceBreak">(BalanceBreak)</a>.
            
            During my student job with the E-Learning laboratory of the 
            University of Fulda I got to enhance my skills with CMS platforms, 
            media productions and digital learning systems. 
            I also had the privilege of working with the Fraunhofer-Institut for
            Computer Graphics Research in Rostock (Ger) which has broadened 
            my horizon and improved my skills in 3D-development and data visualization.
