            Hello!  
            My name is Hayden and I enjoy creating software that
            helps people to learn things, explore 
            or maintain their health.

            Since March 2022 I'm working alongside amazing minds at <a href="https://www.ideenion.de/">Ideenion</a>
            to create Software that's maintainable and easy to use and understand.
            Currently, my responsibilities there are the implementation of a NodeJS + SocketIO + Vue fullstack,
            implementing a 3D-interaction library / plugin for Unreal Engine
            as well as other smaller things on the side.  
            
            Before that I finished my Bc. S. in Digital Media and gained knowledge 
            and skills in media production, programming (JAVA, C, C#), 
            visual design, UX-testing, webdevelopment or E-Learning in 
            the process. 
            
            I was able to gain further work experience 
            during my student job with the e-learning laboratory of the 
            University of Fulda I which provided me with the option 
            to enhance my skills in media productions and digital learning systems (moodle). 
            I also had the privilege of working with the Fraunhofer-Institut for
            Computer Graphics Research in Rostock (Ger) which has broadened 
            my horizon and improved my skills in 3D-software development and 
            data visualization.
