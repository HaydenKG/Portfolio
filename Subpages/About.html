            Hello!  
            My name is Hayden and I enjoy creating software that
            helps people to learn things, explore 
            or maintain their health.
            
            I finished my Bc. S. in Digital Media and learned many things 
            in the process like media production, programming (JAVA, JS, C, C#), 
            visual design, UX-testing, Web-related technologies or E-Learning. 
            That, in combination with things I taught myself with the help 
            of the internet, allows me to build software that can 
            support people in, par example, training their balance <a
                href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RHApplicationStudio.BalanceBreak">(BalanceBreak)</a>.
            
            During my student job with the e-learning laboratory of the 
            University of Fulda I got to enhance my skills in 
            media productions and digital learning systems. 
            I also had the privilege of working with the Fraunhofer-Institut for
            Computer Graphics Research in Rostock (Ger) which has broadened 
            my horizon and improved my skills in 3D-software development and 
            data visualization.

            Currently working on: 
            - a site for a box breathing excersice build with JS and CSS animations
            - further devlopment of BalanceBreak
