            Hello  
            My name is Hayden and I enjoy creating software that
            helps people.
            
            My interest for software development was sparked in school and 
            even more during a side project in which I designing and 
            programmed a little android game to enhance my programming skills.
            
            Anyway, fast-forward to today I learned many things through uni 
            and the internet, which allows me to build software that can 
            support people in, par example, training their balance (BalanceBreak).
            During my student job with the e-learning laboratory of the 
            University of Fulda I got to enhance my skills with CMS platforms, 
            media productions and digital learning systems. 
            I also had the privilege of working with the Fraunhofer-IGD in
            Rostock (Ger) which has broadened my horizon and improved my 
            skills in 3D-development and data visualization.
