            Hello!  
            My name is Hayden and I enjoy creating software with a focus on visual interfaces 
            and web technologies.

            Since March 2022 I'm working alongside amazing minds at <a href="https://www.ideenion.de/" style="font-size:inherit">Ideenion</a>
            to create Software that's maintainable, easy understand and use.
            Currently, my responsibilities are the implementation 
            of a NodeJS + SocketIO + Vue fullstack as well as implementing a 
            3D-interaction library / plugin for Unreal Engine 
            and other smaller things on the side.  
            
            Prior to my current employment, I finished my Bc. S. in Digital Media
            and gained knowledge and skills in media production, programming (JAVA, C, C#), 
            visual design, UX-testing, webdevelopment or E-Learning in the process. 
            
            I gained work experience in the IT industry 
            during my student job with the e-learning laboratory of the 
            University of Fulda which gave me the opportunity to enhance 
            my skills in media productions, administration and digital learning systems (moodle). 
            I also had the privilege of working with the Fraunhofer-Institut for
            Computer Graphics Research in Rostock (Ger) during my practical semster, 
            which has broadened and improved my skills in object-oriented 
            3D-software development and data visualization.
