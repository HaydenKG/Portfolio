            Hello!  
            My name is Hayden and I enjoy creating software that
            helps people to learn things, explore 
            or maintain their health.

            Since March 2022 I'm working alongside amazing minds at <a href="https://www.ideenion.de/">Ideenion</a>
            to create Software that's maintainable and easy to use and understand.
            
            Before that I finished my Bc. S. in Digital Media and gained knowledge 
            and skills in media production, programming (JAVA, C, C#), 
            visual design, UX-testing, webdevelopment or E-Learning in 
            the process. That, in combination with things I taught myself 
            with the help of the internet, allows me to build software that can 
            support people in, par example, training their balance <a
                href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RHApplicationStudio.BalanceBreak">(BalanceBreak)</a>.
            
            During my student job with the e-learning laboratory of the 
            University of Fulda I got to enhance my skills in 
            media productions and digital learning systems. 
            I also had the privilege of working with the Fraunhofer-Institut for
            Computer Graphics Research in Rostock (Ger) which has broadened 
            my horizon and improved my skills in 3D-software development and 
            data visualization.

            Currently working on: 
            - guided box breathing site made with JS- and CSS- animations
            - further development of BalanceBreak 
            - a pomodoro timer with svelte
