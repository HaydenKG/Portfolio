            Hey, I'm Hayden!  
            I enjoy creating software with a focus on visual interfaces, web- and 3D- technologies.

            Since Janurary 2023 I'm working and enjoying my role as a web developer @ <a target="blank" href="https://www.analytical-software.de/en/" style="font-size:inherit">HMS</a>.
            Primarily I'm implementing and designing frontends. 
            For that, I'm currently using tools like React, MUI and TanStack (Query + Router) a lot. 

            From March until December 2022 I worked in an amazing team @ <a target="blank" href="https://www.ideenion.de/" style="font-size:inherit">Ideenion</a>
            There, my responsibilities were the implementation 
            of a NodeJS + SocketIO + Vue fullstack as well as expanding a 
            3D-interaction library / plugin for gesture interaction with Unreal Engine 
            and other smaller things on the side.   on frontends @ <a target="blank" href="https://www.analytical-software.de/en/" style="font-size:inherit">HMS</a>.
            The tools I'm currently using the most are React, MUI, CSS and TanStack (Query + Router).

            Prior to my current employment, I finished my Bc. S. in Digital Media
            and gained knowledge and skills in media production, programming (JAVA, C, C#), 
            visual design, UX-testing, webdevelopment or E-Learning in the process. 
            
            I gained work experience in the IT industry 
            during my student job with the e-learning laboratory of the 
            University of Fulda which gave me the opportunity to enhance 
            my skills in media productions, administration and digital learning systems (moodle). 
            I also had the privilege of working with the Fraunhofer-Institut for
            Computer Graphics Research in Rostock (Ger) during my practical semster, 
            which has broadened and improved my skills in object-oriented 
            3D-software development and data visualization.
