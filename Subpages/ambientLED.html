            <pre>
            After I moved to Ingolstadt, I recognized that my living room was
            lacking ambient light, because let's be honest, your room
            can look very fancy when tinged into a sunset orange or ocean blue. 
            I had the option to simply buy a standing LED lamp,
            but you learn more and it's more fun if you make one yourself.
            Hence, the idea of creating a setup that lets me control
            and customize the lights to my liking from my phone.
            
            The complete setup consists of the ESP8266 starting a web server 
            to be reached from the local network. Serving the frontend files upon request.
            The frontend requests the current status and available animations upon loading.
            It provides the option to change the current color, set a different brightness,
            set a different animation to play. 
            
            The goal being to keep the cognitive load to a minimum during usage 
            for less cognitive load, while also trying to design something
            different than the usual front page with a circle of all available colors.
            
            Design process: 
            - Researched the equipment requirements and what languages they use
            - Ordered an ESP8266, cables and a 1m WS2812 stripe
            - Sketched out multiple ideas of the frontend with Lunacy
            - Implemented a minimum viable prototype of the microprocessor logic and frontend
            - Implemented further features such as animations on the frontend and hardware level 

            Software and technologies used: 
            VS code, Lunacy, Arduino libraries, C, HTML / CSS / JS
            
            Lessons learned: 
            Underlined the importance of writing less code to accomplish the same thing
            while restricting myself to one file to host the CSS, HTML and JS.
            While implementing a wheel you can learn a lot, but if you need speed 
            just go for the libraries already provided.   
            
            Next steps if I were to continue development:
            - Including more animations
            - A fade for the change of colors
