            Temperature, noise, air quality and humidity can be considered as stress 
            factors (stressors) in today's office environments.
            Measuring these stressors can help to gather insights or analyze situations.
            With that knowledge, measures to improve the environmental effects on employees 
            can be taken.
            Though when one has all the measured data it can be hard to see right away if 
            there is an unsuitable value or in which location sensor 1 might be in the building.
            For that matter data visualization in a digital twin can be used to 
            interpret the data faster and locate it more easily. 

            Though the questions arise, how this data can be visualized? 
            What to do if one has multiple data sets of different sensors? 
            And how can one visualize all or some of them at the same time, without having 
            to check them individually? 

            The following WebGL demo answers these questions.
            It's only a sample of the project I developed during my internship and Bachelor 
            thesis with the Fraunhofer-Institut for Computer Graphics Research in Rostock (Ger).
            
            In an original setting the data would be collected through various sensors in the 
            real building, converted into the JSON-file format, sent to a server and be pulled into the program with a web request. 
            In this demo-case the data is generated artificially.
