            <pre>
            Pin's escape is a game my team and I produced for as an exam performance.
            It had to include a 3D-space with code based mesh generation,
            a playable player, sounds, using textured materials and shaders. 

            So the four of us generated the idea and split the tasks.
            Idea being, a penguin who has to find its way through a maze.
            Difficulty being, that it's very dark and seals are hunting you.
            Though one can shoot light bullets to light the way.  

            My job was to take care of the player as well as the 
            bullet and shooting mechanism.

            I sketched out multiple deigns and ended up with 
            a code generated cone mesh that sticks in the ground and 
            has a light attached to it to light the way.

            In the end we were supposed to make a trailer that presents our game.
            Here I was responsible for designing and framing 
            70% of the visual footage captured with the 
            cinemachine package from Unity.
            
            Equipment:
            PCs and a dynamic and calm teamwork atmosphere that allows 
            everyone to play their strength

            Software: 
            Unity, GitHub, Visual Studio Community Edition 
            
            Lessons learned: 
            Better keep the git repo organised.
