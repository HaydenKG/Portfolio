            Entity was the final exam video of 
            the media production course of my group.
            The challenge was to create a video that had real scenes, 
            mixed scenes with 3D-animated objects included and
            having scenes that were entirely 3D-animated. 
            Further requirements were to have various different shots in it.
            I was responsible for the completely 3D-animated scenes,
            as well as the scene leading to it. 
            A lot of my attention went into making sure 
            the different 3D-scenes blend into one another,
            as well as blending smoothly back into the real footage. 
            
            Equipment:
            Nikon D750, 3 moveable LED lights,
            friendly students willing to play a role and
            plenty of props we found in the electrical trash.

            Software: 
            Blender, Davinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro
            
            Lessons learned: 
            Communication is key and 
            you donâ€™t need the biggest camera to achieve good quality.
