            In order to gain more experience with REST APIs and TypeScript I wanted to implement
            a project that uses these two but also is of my interest instead of just following along
            a tutorial. In the sense of "scratch your own itch" - Tim Ferriss, I implemented this stock
            news dashboard that fetches the latest stock prices of the last five days and also the 
            latest news about that company. Companies can be added via a search field that 
            provides you with options of the term you are searching for. I first used the 
            an API from Finnhub but settled with one fron AlphaVantage since they offered 
            everything I needed.
            
            Design process: 
            Drafted out what basic functionalities I wanted
            Researched about API's that fit the requirements
            Design idea sketching with Lunacy
            Turning the visual mockup into a minimal viable prototype

            Software and technologies used: 
            Vite, Vue 3, TypeScript, VS code, Lunacy and HTML + CSS
            
            Lessons learned: 
            The project helped me to understand sure that in the future I scan API documentations
            more thoroughly before implementing a feature myself that is already provided.
            Deepen component based implementation.
            
            Next steps if I were to continue development:
            - Extend the data structure to check if the latest fetched data is still new 
            and only fetch new data if that is not the case to save on API calls 
            - adding the functionality to focus a company panel and see more articles 
            as well as a stock price graph that dates back to a month / year
