            At Ideenion we use an application to capture our work times
            that, let's say it this way, has quite some potential in 
            terms of design and usability.
            In order to gain deeper knowledge and skill of Vue,
            I thought to myself, it would be a good learning opportunity
            to create a work- and break-time capturing tool myself. Saving
            the dates in the local browser storage.
            
            Design process: 
            I first drafted out what basic functionalities I want to provide.
            Based on that, I sketched out some ideas with Lunacy
            to get a sense for the layout.
            Finally, I turned the visual mockup into a minimal viable prototype.

            Software and technologies used: 
            VS code, Lunacy, HTML + CSS and Vue 3
            
            Lessons learned: 
            The project helped me to make sure that in the future I scan API documentations
            more thoroughly before implementing a feature myself that is already provided.
            Deepen component based implementation.
            Due to the development process being mainly done during the weekends, it 
            also made me learn more about code readability and taking a step back 
            again to reassess the way of a current feature implementation for reevaluation.
            
            Next steps if I were to continue development:
            - Including a week section
            - exporting the saved time data in .xls as well
            - customly set your days off instead of the Sa. and Sun. default 
            - come up with a different design for the day page
