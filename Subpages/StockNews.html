            In order to gain more experience with REST APIs and TypeScript I wanted to implement
            a project that uses these two but also is of my interest instead of just following along
            a tutorial. In the sense of "scratch your own itch" - Tim Ferriss, I implemented this stock
            news dashboard that fetches the latest stock prices of the last five days as well as the
            latest news about that company. Companies can be added via a search field that 
            provides you with options of the term you are searching for. I first used the 
            an API from Finnhub but settled with one from AlphaVantage since they offered 
            everything I needed.
            
            <i>Design process: </i>
            Drafted out what basic functionalities I wanted
            Researched about API's that fit the requirements
            Sketched out visual design ideas with Lunacy
            Turned the visual mockup into a prototype

            <i>Software and technologies used: </i>
            Vite, Vue 3, TypeScript, HTML + CSS, VS code and Lunacy
            
            <i>Lessons learned: </i>
            The project helped me to expand my knowledge of the structure and
            behaviour of REST APIs. In the future, I'll make sure to take my time choosing the right API 
            before having to invest time again to restructure code later along the line if another
            API fits better.
            
            <i>Next steps if I were to continue development:</i>
            - Extend the data structure to check if the latest fetched data is still new 
               and only fetch new data if that is not the case to save on API calls 
            - adding the functionality to focus a company panel and see more articles 
               as well as a stock price graph that dates back to a month / year
